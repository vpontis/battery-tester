Battery Tester
==============

Overview
--------

This repository contains code and instructions on how to test a battery using an Arduino. I set this up for a cell phone lithium-ion battery for [CoBattery](www.cobattery.com) but this set up can be generalized to other batteries.

Currently the code allows you to look at voltage and current over time as the battery discharges and gives an estimate of the battery's capacity.

Set Up 
------

###Materials

+ Arduino Uno
+ Wire
+ Resistors
+ Voltmeter
+ SD Card add on and SD card (optional but helpful)

Notes
-----

If you over-discharge your battery, do not recharge it. This is dangerous. Over discharing a battery can often cause irreparable chemical damage.
